# SnowCV

This is a repo to house a new tutorial that is in development to capture snow depth from 'phenocam' images using computer vision.
Donal is developing this method in order to derive a new snow depth data product from NEON's phenocam imagery, and to create a new tutorial explaining this process for NEON's Data Skills user community.
